Box2D.NET Release 🎉

We’re excited to announce the first release of Box2D.NET 3.1.0!
This is a C# port of the original Box2D, which was written in C — now bringing a lightweight and fast 2D physics engine to the .NET ecosystem.

More than just a direct port, it’s been carefully refined to feel natural and intuitive for C# developers.
After many trials and iterations, we’re truly happy to finally share the result.

Huge thanks to everyone who showed interest and supported the project along the way! 🙏
